                                    Difference between Horizontal Partitioning and Sharding



1.  In Horizontal Partitioning, we split the table into multiple tables in the same database instance. 

2.  Where as in sharding we split the table into multiple tables across multiple database instances.


3.  In Horizontal partitioning, we use the same database instance so the names of the partitioned tables have to be different. 

4.  In sharding, since the tables are stored in different databaseinstances, table names can be the same or different.
