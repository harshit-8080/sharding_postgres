1. Database sharding is the process of dividing the data into partitions which can then be stored inmultiple database instance.

2.  It uses some key to partition the data. This key is an attribute of the data that you are storing.



Working

Suppose, there are 1000 users in your database and you have 5 database servers. 
You want to shardthe data on userID. So you can partition the data in the following manner


userID 000 - 199 -> database 1.
userID 200 - 399 -> database 2.
userID 400 - 599 -> database 3.
userID 600 - 799 -> database 4.
userID 800 - 999 -> database 5.



Now if the userID 546 wants to perform read/write operations, 
he will only connect to databaseinstance-3. And since there are only 200 userIDs, query processing will be fast.


Above is example of range based sharding.
